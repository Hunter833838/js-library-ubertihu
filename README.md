### Purpose ###
The purpose of the BetterTable library is to give the user useful and intiutive ways to interact with data presented to them in a traditional HTML table

A BetterTable is essentially a wrapper for an classic HTML table, giving it additional functionality, including (but not limited to):

-Click on a column header to sort the data in that column (and the corresponding rows) alphabetically or numerically
-Reorder columns by dragging and dropping headers to show relevant information closer to each other
-Search the contents of a column to narrow down results
-Refer to the examples page to see these features in action!

The developer of this library wanted to make these features easily accessible to users while making it very simple for web developers to implement.

The library also gives developers many useful features including:

-Easily add additional rows and columns after instantiation
-Parse the contents of any table and store in a friendly format
-Create a BetterTable from raw data

### Required Files ###
To use the BetterTables library, include the BetterTables.js and BetterTables.css files in your web project. That's it!
